## ADR 0006 — Data Quality and Governance for Knowledge Layer

### Context

ADR 0004 (LLM Wiki) and ADR 0005 (RAG and Agent Memory) establish three knowledge patterns for the Integral stack.

The article identifies a critical gap that most teams underinvest in:

> "The governance layer underneath all of them — data quality, freshness, access control — is what most teams underinvest in.
> Stale or ungoverned inputs degrade all three simultaneously."

This ADR establishes the governance requirements that apply across all three knowledge patterns.

### Decision

Implement four governance requirements across the knowledge layer.

#### Requirement 1: Source Provenance

Required for all wiki pages.
Every concept page must cite at least one source page.
No synthesized claim without a backing source.
`wiki lint` enforces this.
Pages with missing `sourceIds` fail validation.

#### Requirement 2: Freshness Tracking

Required for all concept pages.
Every page carries `updatedAt`.
It is checked by `wiki lint` for staleness.
Pages older than 30 days without update trigger a stale-page warning.

#### Requirement 3: Contradiction Detection

Enforced by `wiki lint`.
When two concept pages make conflicting claims, `wiki lint` surfaces the contradiction.
A human must adjudicate.
The resolution gets recorded as a new claim with `status: resolved` and evidence pointing to the adjudication source.

#### Requirement 4: Ingest Quality Gates

Required before wiki commit.
Before any source page is committed to the vault:

- Source must be cited in at least one concept page.
- Concept page must pass `wiki lint` with 0 errors.
- Source must have valid `provenance` frontmatter.
Source URL or file path.

### Options Considered

| Option | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Trust LLM ingest quality | Rejected — errors compound in LLM Wiki. |

No quality gate means bad synthesis baked permanently. |
| Manual review every ingest | Rejected — unsustainable at scale.
Creates bottleneck. |
| Automated lint + provenance + staleness checks | Adopted — `wiki lint` enforces all four requirements. |

### Consequences

#### Positive

- All three knowledge patterns share the same governance foundation.
- Quality degradation caught before propagation.
- Clear audit trail: source → concept → claim → evidence.
- Wikilink integrity maintained via `wiki lint`.

#### Negative

- Ingest workflow is slower.
Requires lint plus provenance before commit.
- Contradiction adjudication requires human time.

#### Risks

- If `wiki lint` is not run after every ingest, governance requirements slip.
- Staleness warnings can pile up if vault is not actively maintained.

### Implementation

These requirements are enforced by `openclaw wiki lint` in the standard workflow:

```text
openclaw wiki ingest <source>
openclaw wiki compile
openclaw wiki lint  # fails if: missing sourceIds, missing provenance, stale page, contradiction
```

Wiki vault mode `isolated` means all governance is self-contained.
No external dependency.
